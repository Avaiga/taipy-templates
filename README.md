## What is Taipy templates

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our [website](https://www.taipy.io).

Taipy templates is a repository that contains templates and scaffoldings created and maintained by Taipy. It helps users getting started with a simple and ready-to-go application.

A more in depth documentation of taipy can be found [here](https://docs.taipy.io).

To create a Taipy application using this template, first you need to install Taipy (> 2.2). Then from a terminal, run the following command.
```
$ taipy create
```
or
```
$ taipy create --template "default"
```

After providing necessary information, your new application is created in the current working directory.
